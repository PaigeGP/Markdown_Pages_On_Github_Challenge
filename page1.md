## A Brief Synopsis

[PokePark 2: Wonders Beyond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9Park_2:_Wonders_Beyond) is the sequel to first game [PokePark: Pikachu's Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9Park_Wii:_Pikachu%27s_Adventure). I absolutely loved this game growing up and always wished they would have made a third in the series. This game is a cute and thrilling journey through the world of PokePark. You travel to a place called Wish Park and it is up to you to save the pokemon trapped there in order to save PokePark.

*This game is a very simple game meant primarly for children's enjoyment and even after revisiting it I still enjoyed the gameplay. I defintely recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Pokemon and is looking for a game that different than the traditonal RPGs.*
