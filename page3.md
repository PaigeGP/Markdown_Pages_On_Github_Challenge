## A Brief Synopsis

There is no plot to the game Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA MegaMix. This game is rhythmm game that features many vocaloid songs. I will leave links below in the footnotes to the Project DIVA wiki and a page explaining what vocaloid is. 

######(Brief explanation for vocaloid is that it is a software that models a human singing voice digitally).
