## A Brief Synopsis

There is no plot to the game [Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA MegaMix](https://miku.sega.com/megamixplus/). This game is rhythmm game that features many vocaloid songs. I will leave links below in the footnotes to the Project DIVA wiki and a page explaining what vocaloid is. 

###### (Brief explanation for vocaloid is that it is a software that models a human singing voice digitally).

*I have always been a fan or rhythmn games, whether they be mobile or on the PC, so the release of Project DIVA was a must have for any vocaloid fan. I wanted to play this game series for a while but because it was a Playsation exclusive I was never able to play until SEGA released this version of the game.*
